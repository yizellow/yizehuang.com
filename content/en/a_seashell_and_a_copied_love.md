When I was nineteen, I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome.  
It explained why, ever since I was young, I had always felt out of place among other people.

I felt relieved to finally understand myself, but at the same time, I was angry about all the misunderstandings and unfairness I had endured in the past.  
Before that, I felt like a machine hiding in human society, doing everything I could to imitate others so as not to be discovered.

Whenever I told people that I have Asperger’s, they would look at me in disbelief.  
I often told them, “I don’t really feel anything about what you’re going through, but I can pretend to cry for you.”

Even after saying this, some people still didn’t believe me—  
which probably meant that I acted well enough.

Later, I learned that people with mild symptoms like mine often share similar experiences.  
Because we are born sensitive and intelligent, able to observe, imitate, and predict others’ behavior, we often appear more socially capable than average—yet that doesn’t mean we truly empathize.

When we encounter situations that require a genuine emotional response, we can freeze.  
Especially when it comes to something like love.

In the winter before the pandemic, I went with a group of my hippie friends from Taiwan to a hippie music festival in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

Among us was a very beautiful girl.  
As soon as we arrived, she quickly attracted a great deal of attention from men.

A French guy approached us.  
While chatting and joking, he took out a small box filled with seashells. He said he had collected them from beaches all over the world and invited each of us to choose one as a souvenir.

What he really wanted was to use these shells to express his affection for that girl.  
The rest of us were mostly there to awkwardly fill the space.

Even so, I couldn’t help admiring his way of courting someone.

Over the following days, whenever he saw me, he would ask where she was, how she was doing that day.  
I could clearly feel how strong his feelings for her were.

Perhaps because I was too curious about what it feels like to love and to be loved, I found myself inexplicably moved—  
even though I knew those feelings were not meant for me.

After that, I began to imitate him.  
I started collecting seashells from beaches around the world. I collected many of them, but I never gave a single one away.

Mostly because I didn’t know who I should give them to.  
Even if there were someone, these shells would not truly represent my feelings—they would only be copied emotions.

In the end, I stopped collecting altogether and threw all the shells away at once.  
I kept only the one the French boy had given me.

At the end of the festival, the French boy invited us to travel with him through Thailand and onward to India.  
But we didn’t go with him.

The beautiful girl also didn’t choose any of the many men who pursued her.  
Instead, she fell in love with another girl and moved to a different province in Thailand, where they lived together for several months.

Even sincere love can eventually turn into nothing—  
as if it never began at all.
