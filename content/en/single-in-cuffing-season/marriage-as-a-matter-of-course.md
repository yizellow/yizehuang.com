## Marriage, as a Matter of Course

::quote

> In The Symposium, written by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, Aristophanes tells an allegorical story to explain why humans long for love and union.
> He says that in the beginning, humans were not single beings as they are now. There were three types: male–male (children of the sun), female–female (children of the earth), and male–female (children of the moon).
> Each original human had four arms, four legs, two faces facing opposite directions on one head, and two sets of genitals. They were fast and powerful, and even attempted to challenge the gods. Zeus, wanting to weaken them without destroying humanity—since that would leave no one to offer sacrifices—came up with a solution: he split them in half with lightning, turning each into two separate individuals.
> After being split, each person felt deep loss and emptiness and began searching for their missing half. When they found each other again, they felt strong attraction and love, longing to become whole once more. <mark class="bg-primary">This, Aristophanes said, is the origin of human love.</mark>

When I was twenty-one, I was married once, to a girl who was too beautiful and too intelligent. In that marriage, I did not love her, and she did not love me. We were young, and we both longed for love, but we fell in love with the wrong people. So instead of the beauty of love, what we felt first was pain.

That year, she had a major fight with her family. She wanted to anger them at any cost, and she chose to do so by marrying me. She was an American citizen of Taiwanese descent. Knowing that I was going to the United States for six months, she asked if I wanted to marry her. We could get married once in Taiwan, and after I arrived in the U.S., she would fly over and we would marry again in Las Vegas. That way, I could get a green card and leave my life in Taiwan behind.

My mother had always told me that marriage was just a piece of paper, so in my mind it did not seem like a big deal. I agreed. I also casually told my mother, which shocked her. She told me I should at least buy the girl a ring as a symbol of commitment. I sold some stocks and chose a Cartier ring for her.

In my experience, marriage is not necessarily a symbol of happiness. There is a saying that “marriage is the grave of love.” Being together does not always make people stronger. I have seen many people severely wounded in marriage. Perhaps they treated marriage as a solution to emotional problems. This meaningless marriage, however, was the opposite for me—it was a form of relief. Telling others that I was married meant that I was already settled, no longer fighting on the battlefield of courtship, no longer getting hurt, and no longer having to face how unsuccessful I was in love.

Naturally, she never flew to the United States. We never married in Las Vegas, and I never got a green card. In the end, I did not come to like America either, so I felt no regret. When I returned to Taiwan, we divorced quickly and stopped being friends. I rarely think of her now. But I often take out the wedding photo I keep in my wallet and joke with others, saying, “I never had love, but I did have a marriage.
