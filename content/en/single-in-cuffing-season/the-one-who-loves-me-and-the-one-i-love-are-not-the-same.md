## The one who loves me and the one I love are not the same.

I often feel angry at the gym. When I see men and women with perfect bodies, I always feel that life comes easily to them, and that love has never really been a problem for them. A friend of mine has a boss who is exactly that type—he looks like a model from a Zara advertisement. His biggest problem in life is that every woman who approaches him only wants to have sex with him and does not want to give sincere love. I envy how easily they can obtain what I have spent my entire life searching for. I don’t understand what I did wrong. I go to the gym every day. I study hard, work hard, donate money, and do good deeds. Why is it that I still can’t find someone I love who also loves me?

I once heard a story. In Taiwan’s mainstream education system, exam results almost equal a student’s value. In an advanced academic class`[1]`, there was a girl who ranked second and had a crush on the boy who ranked first. She believed that as long as she studied hard and entered the most prestigious university together with him, she would be worthy of him, they would be together, and live happily ever after. In the end, they did get into the same university, but the boy did not fall in love with her. Instead, he fell in love with another girl who had not even graduated from a technical college`[2]`. In love, it seems very difficult to judge the two sides of the equation.

When I was seventeen or eighteen, carefree and reckless, I did not plunge into a passionate, dramatic romance. Year after year of being single, as I became more independent, relationships only became more difficult. Being in a relationship is like merging two lives into one. I have tried my best to live a good life on my own, and at this point I ask myself: “If another person enters my life, will it become better, or worse?” Over the years, I have not lacked people who pursued me, and my desire for love still exists. However, as I grow older, there are many practical realities I must consider. Being in a relationship does not mean I don’t have to go to work tomorrow; mortgages and student loans still have to be paid. I am increasingly unsure whether the future will really be like a fairy tale, where someone appears and <mark class="opacity-75

::footnote
`[1]` In Taiwan, students take entrance examinations in junior high school and are assigned to different senior high schools based on their scores. Many high schools further divide students into separate classes, and those with higher academic performance—aiming for admission to top universities—are placed into so-called “college-preparatory classes,” where they receive focused training from the school.

<br/>

`[2]` Four-year technical colleges and two-year junior colleges usually place less emphasis on academic scores and prioritize students’ future vocational and technical skills instead.

`[3]` <mark class="bg-primary opacity-75">I once heard someone use Sartre’s saying, “Hell is other people” (L'enfer, c'est les autres), to describe the state of being in love. People are supposed to live for themselves; however, in the blindness of love, individuals often neglect their own existence and even willingly devote their lives and sense of meaning to another person.<mark>
