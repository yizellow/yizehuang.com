## A Seashell and a Copied Love

When I was nineteen, I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. It explained why I had always felt out of place among others. I felt relieved, but also angry about the injustices I had endured in the past. Before that, I was like a robot hiding in human society, doing everything I could to imitate others’ behavior in order not to be discovered. Whenever I told people I had Asperger’s, they usually showed a look of disbelief. I would tell them, “I don’t really feel anything about what you’re going through, but I will pretend to cry for you.” Even after saying this, some people still didn’t believe me, which meant I had acted well enough. I heard that people with mild symptoms like mine often have similar experiences. Because we are naturally sensitive and intelligent, able to imitate and predict others’ behavior, we often appear more socially skilled than average, but without true empathy. When faced with situations that require a genuine emotional response, we crash—such as love.

In the winter before the COVID-19 pandemic, I went with a group of my hippie friends from Taiwan to a hippie music festival in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Among my friends was a very beautiful girl, and as soon as we arrived, she quickly attracted a lot of male attention. A French boy approached us. While chatting and laughing with us, he took out a box full of seashells. He said he had collected them from beaches around the world and asked each of us to choose one as a souvenir. What he really wanted was to use the shells to express his affection for that girl, while the rest of us were just awkward extras. Still, I had to admire his way of pleasing women. In the following days, whenever he saw me, he would ask where she was, how she was doing that day. I could clearly feel his strong love for her. Perhaps out of curiosity about the feeling of loving and being loved, I felt inexplicably moved, even though I knew those feelings were not directed at me.

After that, I imitated him and began collecting seashells from beaches around the world. I collected many, but never gave a single one away. I didn’t know who to give them to. Even if there were someone, these shells could not represent my true feelings; they were only copied emotions. Eventually, I stopped collecting them and threw them all away at once, keeping only the one the French boy had given me.

At the end of the festival, the French boy invited us to travel with him through Thailand to India, but we did not go. The beautiful girl also did not choose any of the many men; instead, she fell in love with another girl and lived for several months in another province of Thailand. Even a sincere love can eventually turn into nothing, as if it never began.
